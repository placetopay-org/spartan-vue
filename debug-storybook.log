[01:55:09.694] [INFO] Upgrading from 8.3.0 to 9.1.2
[01:55:09.722] [ERROR] Blockers detected

Storybook has found potential blockers that need to be resolved before upgrading:

vite version < 5.0.0 support removed

Support for vite version < 5.0.0 has been removed.
Storybook needs a minimum version of 5.0.0, but you have version 4.5.5.

Affected projects: C:/Users/Juan/Evertec/spartan-vue/.storybook

After addressing this, you can try running the upgrade command again. You can also rerun the upgrade command with the --force flag to skip the blocker check and to proceed with the upgrade.
