# Usage

The SPlacetopayLogo component renders the Placetopay brand logo with support for different visual modes and customizable dimensions.

::spartan-component
---
items: { mode: ['base', 'dark', 'blackAndWhite'] }
props:
  mode: base
ignore:
  - width
  - height
  - size
  - class
---
::

## Modes

Choose between three color modes depending on your background: base (gray), dark (white), or blackAndWhite.

::spartan-component
---
items: { mode: ['base', 'dark', 'blackAndWhite'] }
props:
  mode: base
ignore:
  - width
  - height
  - size
  - class
---
::

## Predefined Size

Use the `size` prop for quick sizing. The "md" size sets the width to 202px automatically while maintaining the aspect ratio.

::spartan-component
---
items: { size: ['md'] }
props:
  size: md
  mode: base
ignore:
  - width
  - height
  - class
---
::

## Custom Dimensions

Set custom dimensions using the `width` and `height` props. The component maintains a 202:45 aspect ratio by default.

::spartan-component
---
props:
  mode: base
  width: 300
ignore:
  - height
  - size
  - class
