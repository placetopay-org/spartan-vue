# Usage

`SModalSide` is a full-height modal panel that can slide in from either the left or right side of the screen. It extends the concept of `SModalLeft` by adding a configurable `side` prop.

Control visibility with the `:open` prop and handle closing via the `@close` and `@backdrop-click` events.

::component-preview{file="SModalSide/basic"}

## Side

Use the `side` prop to control which edge the panel slides in from. Defaults to `'left'`.

::component-preview{file="SModalSide/side"}
