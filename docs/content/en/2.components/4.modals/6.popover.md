# Usage

`SPopover` displays a floating panel positioned relative to a reference element. It uses Floating UI for smart positioning and supports arrows, responsive behavior, and focus management.

The `#reference` slot provides handler functions (`toggle`, `open`, `close`, `isOpen`) to control the popover from the trigger element.

::component-preview{file="SPopover/basic"}
::

## Placement

Use the `placement` prop to control where the floating panel appears relative to the trigger.

::component-preview{file="SPopover/placement"}
::

## Arrow

Use the `arrow` prop to display a directional arrow pointing to the reference element. Available values are `'auto'`, `'light'`, and `'dark'`.

::component-preview{file="SPopover/arrow"}
::

## Responsive

When `responsive` is `true` (default), the popover displays as a bottom sheet on mobile screens and as a floating panel on larger screens.

::component-preview{file="SPopover/responsive"}
::

## Prevent Close

When `preventClose` is enabled, the popover won't close when focus leaves the floating element. The user must close it explicitly through the trigger.

::component-preview{file="SPopover/prevent-close"}
