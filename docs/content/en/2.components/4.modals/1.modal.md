# Usage

`SModal` is a low-level modal that teleports content to the body with a backdrop overlay, fade/slide transitions, and automatic scroll lock. It does not include any styled content — you provide your own card, form, or layout inside.

Use `v-model:open` or `:open` + `@update:open` to control visibility.

::component-preview{file="SModal/basic"}
::

## Responsive

By default, `responsive` is `true`. On mobile, the modal content is positioned at the bottom of the screen. On larger screens (`sm` breakpoint and above), it is vertically centered. Set `responsive` to `false` to always center the content.

::component-preview{file="SModal/responsive"}
::

## Prevent Close

When `preventClose` is enabled, clicking the backdrop does not close the modal. The user must dismiss it through an explicit action, such as a close button inside the content.

::component-preview{file="SModal/prevent-close"}
