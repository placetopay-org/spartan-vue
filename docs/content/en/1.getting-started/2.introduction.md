**Spartan** is the unified component system from PlaceToPay, built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It provides more than 50 ready-to-use components for all web applications across the organization.

## What is Spartan?

Spartan is a Vue 3 component library designed specifically to standardize the user interface across PlaceToPay applications. Its goal is to ensure visual and behavioral consistency without sacrificing flexibility.

The library is distributed as an npm package and integrates natively into any project that uses Vue 3 and TailwindCSS.
