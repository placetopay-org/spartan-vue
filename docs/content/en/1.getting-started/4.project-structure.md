## Integration in your project

Spartan is installed as a development dependency and does not require any changes to your application's folder structure. In TailwindCSS v4 the integration is done entirely from your CSS stylesheet, without JavaScript configuration files.

Below are the files you need to create or modify:

::code-tree{default-value="src/main.ts"}

```json [package.json]
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "^3.5.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@placetopay/spartan-vue": "latest",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0",
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "latest"
  }
}
```

```css [styles.css]
@import "@placetopay/spartan-vue/styles.css";

@source '../src/**/*.{vue,js,ts}';
```

```ts [src/main.ts]
import './styles.css'

import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)
app.mount('#app')
```

```vue [src/App.vue]
<script setup>
import { SButton, SInput, SCard } from '@placetopay/spartan-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <SCard>
    <SInput placeholder="Your name" />
    <SButton>Submit</SButton>
  </SCard>
</template>
```

::prose-tip
The Spartan `@import` in `styles.css` must be **before** any other custom styles. The `@source` directive tells TailwindCSS which files to scan to generate classes.
::

## Import convention

All Spartan components are exported from the main package. It is not necessary to import from internal paths:

```vue
<script setup>
// ✅ Correct
import { SButton, SInput, SCard } from '@placetopay/spartan-vue'

// ❌ Incorrect — do not import from internal paths
// import SButton from '@placetopay/spartan-vue/components/SButton'
</script>
```

::prose-tip
All Spartan components follow the `S` prefix convention (e.g. `SButton`, `SInput`, `SCard`). This makes it easy to identify them in your templates and avoids naming conflicts with other components.
