## Component styles are not applying

This is the most frequent issue during integration. Check the following points:

### The Spartan `@import` is not in your CSS file

In TailwindCSS v4 the Spartan styles are included via an `@import` in your main stylesheet. If it is missing, no component styles will be generated.

**Solution:** Make sure your stylesheet includes the import:

```css [styles.css]
@import "@placetopay/spartan-vue/styles.css"; /* ✅ must be present */

@source '../src/**/*.{vue,js,ts}';
```

### The `@source` directive is not configured

TailwindCSS v4 needs to know which files to scan to generate classes. Without `@source`, it only generates classes found within CSS imports.

**Solution:** Add the `@source` directive with the paths to your files:

```css [styles.css]
@import "@placetopay/spartan-vue/styles.css";

@source '../src/**/*.{vue,js,ts}'; /* ✅ must include your Vue files */
```

### The stylesheet is not imported

If `styles.css` is not imported in your entry point, the styles will never load into the application.

**Solution:** Import the file in `main.ts`:

```ts [main.ts]
import './styles.css' // must be the first import
```

## Component internal texts are not translating

Some Spartan components include default text (for example, confirmation buttons or placeholders). If these texts appear in English, it is likely that `vue-i18n` is not configured correctly.

**Solution:** Review the [i18n configuration guide](/en/getting-started/i18n) and make sure that:

1. `vue-i18n` is installed and registered as a plugin
2. Spartan's translations are imported from `@placetopay/spartan-vue/locales`
3. The `legacy: false` mode is enabled

## Primary colors are not applying

If the components show a different color than the one you configured, check the location and format of your `@theme` block.

### `@theme` placed before the `@import`

The `@theme` variables must be defined **after** the Spartan `@import` so they override the default values.

**Solution:** Make sure of the correct order in your stylesheet:

```css [styles.css]
@import "@placetopay/spartan-vue/styles.css";

@source '../src/**/*.{vue,js,ts}';

/* ✅ @theme after @import */
@theme {
  --color-spartan-primary-500: rgb(33 150 243);
}
```

### Incorrect color variable format

Color variable values must use the RGB format without commas:

```css
/* ❌ Incorrect */
--color-spartan-primary-500: rgb(33, 150, 243);

/* ✅ Correct */
--color-spartan-primary-500: rgb(33 150 243);
```

## TypeScript errors

### "Module not found: @placetopay/spartan-vue"

This error indicates the package is not installed correctly. Reinstall it:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @placetopay/spartan-vue
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @placetopay/spartan-vue
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev @placetopay/spartan-vue
```
::

And verify the package appears in `node_modules/@placetopay/spartan-vue/`.

### Unrecognized types in imported components

If TypeScript does not recognize the types of Spartan components, make sure your `tsconfig.json` does not explicitly exclude the `node_modules/@placetopay/spartan-vue` folder.

## Issues with pnpm

If you are using `pnpm` as your package manager and encounter module resolution errors, enable hoisting:

```bash [.npmrc]
shamefully-hoist=true
```

This setting generates a flat `node_modules` structure similar to npm, resolving most compatibility issues.
